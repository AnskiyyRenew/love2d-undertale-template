# SoulEngine - A LOVE2D UNDERTALE Fangame Template

A template for creating fan games inspired by https://undertale.com/, built on the https://love2d.org/ framework. It provides a straightforward starting point for fans who wish to create their own Undertale-style games.

This project is influenced by the https://github.com/RhenaudTheLukark/CreateYourFrisk engine and consequently shares similarities in certain aspects of its workflow and design.

## Credits
This template utilizes the following excellent libraries:
*   [MD5](https://github.com/kikito/md5.lua) by kikito – A pure-Lua 5.1 implementation of the MD5 algorithm.
*   [dkjson](http://dkolf.de/dkjson-lua/) – A JSON module for Lua that supports UTF-8.
*   [STI](https://github.com/karai17/Simple-Tiled-Implementation) by karai17 – A Tiled map loader and renderer for LÖVE.
*   [sock](https://github.com/camchenry/sock.lua) by camchenry – A networking library for LÖVE, making it easy to get started with multiplayer features.

## Prerequisites
*   **Familiarity with https://undertale.com/.**
*   The **https://love2d.org/** engine, version **11.3** or compatible, must be installed on your system. Future updates will aim to maintain compatibility with newer LÖVE versions.

## How to Use the Template

### On PC (Recommended)
For development and testing, it is recommended to use an editor like https://code.visualstudio.com/ with relevant extensions for LÖVE/Lua, or any other code editor of your choice.

**To run the game:**
*   If your editor supports running LÖVE projects, use that feature.
*   Alternatively, you can run the game by dragging the main project folder onto the `love.exe` (or `lovec.exe` on Windows) executable.

### On Mobile (Android)
You can browse and edit the game's script files using a capable file manager application, such as https://mt2.cn.
